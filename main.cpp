 *              For each position chech all 8 directions. This can be optimized, but will not make much difference in teh runtime. 
 *              We want to check each position for 8 directions before we move onto another position because the value of our current
 *              position is already on the cache memory. Otherwise, if we checked for 1 direction everyy point, then for another direction 
 *              each point, computer would have to spend time accessing the value of the same point in cache 8 times...
 *              Also, we will first check where are the pebbles on the board. That will take 1 iteration,, which is better then checking each
 *              spot for 8 directions.
